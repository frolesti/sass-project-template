# This is a template for starting a project with a SASS structure.

The main idea is to separate things into 3 parts:
  * **Base**: things like base styles, resets, typography, variables, mixins, etc.
  * **Components**: the different pieces of the website.
  * **Layout**: how the components relate to each other.

I like to think like this: a component works with padding, a layout works with margins.
